# Parking Lot Management Smart Contract Overview

The `parkinglot::parkinglot` module is a smart contract written in the Move programming language, designed to manage a decentralized parking lot system. This contract includes functionalities for managing parking slots, processing payments, and system administration.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to create a transparent and efficient parking lot management system on a decentralized platform. It aims to ensure fair management of parking slots, accurate tracking of parking durations, and proper handling of payments and revenue.

## Features

- **Slot Management**: Allows administrators to create and manage parking slots.
- **Slot Reservation and Usage**: Enables users to reserve, occupy, and vacate parking slots.
- **Payment Processing**: Facilitates the creation of payment records and calculation of parking fees.
- **Revenue Management**: Allows administrators to withdraw and distribute revenue generated by the parking lot.

## Structs

- `Slot`: Represents a parking slot, including a unique ID, status, start time, and end time.
- `ParkingLot`: Represents a parking lot, including a unique ID, admin address, list of parking slots, and SUI token balance.
- `PaymentRecord`: Represents a payment record, including a unique ID, amount, and payment time.
- `AdminCap`: Represents administrator capabilities, including a unique ID and admin address.

## Functions

- `init`: Initializes the contract by setting up the administrator and parking lot.
- `create_slot`: Allows administrators to create a new parking slot.
- `reserve_slot`: Reserves a parking slot by setting its status to occupied.
- `enter_slot`: Occupies a parking slot and records the start time.
- `exit_slot`: Vacates a parking slot and records the end time.
- `create_payment_record`: Creates a payment record.
- `calculate_parking_fee`: Calculates the parking fee.
- `withdraw_profits`: Withdraws profits from the parking lot (ensures the caller is an administrator).
- `distribute_profits`: Distributes profits of the parking lot.
- `test_generate_slots`: Function for testing slot generation.

# Deployment and Testing Instructions

## Deployment

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that all necessary tools and dependencies are installed as per the setup instructions mentioned.
2. **Build Package**: Use the command `sui move build` to build the package.
3. **Publish Package**: Publish the package using the command `sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 --json`. Extract the package ID and other necessary information from the output.
4. **Configure Connectivity**: Run `sui client active-address` and provide details such as node URL and configuration name to configure connectivity to the local node.
5. **Get Tokens**: Obtain SUI tokens for testing using the appropriate command (`curl` or `sui client faucet`).
6. **Switch to Testnet**: If testing on the testnet, switch to the testnet environment using `sui client switch --env testnet`.
7. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the smart contract to the desired environment using the extracted package ID and other relevant information.

## Testing

1. **Unit Testing**: Run unit tests using the command `sui move test`.
2. **Manual Testing**: Interact manually with the deployed contract using CLI commands provided in the contract documentation. Test various functionalities such as creating parking slots, reserving slots, handling payments, and managing revenue.
3. **Integration Testing**: Conduct integration testing by simulating real-world scenarios and ensure that the contract behaves as expected under different conditions.
4. **Error Handling**: Test error handling mechanisms by intentionally triggering error conditions and verify that the contract responds with the correct error codes.
5. **Gas Usage**: Monitor gas usage during testing to ensure that the contract operates within acceptable gas limits and does not exceed the specified gas budget.
6. **Security Audit**: Consider performing a security audit to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the contract code.
7. **Feedback and Iteration**: Gather feedback from testing and iterate on contract design and implementation as needed to enhance functionality, performance, and security.
